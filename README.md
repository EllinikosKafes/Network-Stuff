# Network-Stuff

This repository is meant for networking tools written in python 3. As of now, there is only one tool available and that tool is [Ping Scan.py](https://github.com/EllinikosKafes/Network-Stuff/blob/main/src/Ping%20scan.py), more will soon be added !

<br>

## Ping Scan

Ping scan is a tool that searches all available hosts in a given network and prints out to the terminal what address is currently active or not by, as the name implies, pinging them.

<br>

**Ping scan uses the following libraries**

- subprocess
- threading
- time


<br>

\**This tool is still being developed and it will change over time*
